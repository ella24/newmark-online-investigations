# IDEAS

## Potential Assignments

- Look for three articles that touch on three different issues that interest you and you think might be ripe for investigating further. 
- For each article, post a separate Slack message in the `#articles-stories` channel that includes the link and a sentence or two about the article explaining a) what caught your eye and b) how we might build on it with an investigation.  
- You can't post articles someone else has posted! So act fast :-)

- Dox yourself

- Follow along with [this slide deck](https://www.slideshare.net/onlinenewsassociation/digital-forensics-using-social-and-online-tools-to-find-great-stories-ona19) Focus in particular with the tools Jane Lytvynenko uses starting on slide 31.
- Try three of "Jane's tools and resources" ([on slide 49 of this deck](https://www.slideshare.net/onlinenewsassociation/digital-forensics-using-social-and-online-tools-to-find-great-stories-ona19)) to get a feel for how they work. Post a screen shot of something interesting you found using each tool (so three images total) into the shared Slack channel. Due by noon on December 9, 2019.
