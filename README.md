# Online Investigations at Newmark J School

This is the syllabus, details, and dynamic notes for an investigative journalism [course](https://www.journalism.cuny.edu/courses/online-investigations-2020-election/) at the Newmark Graduate School of Journalism in the Spring of 2020.

# Welcome!

Welcome to this special investigations class geared toward gaining real-world experience investigating online political influence ahead of the 2020 election. We'll be working with the Quartz investigations team, led by John Keefe, to:

- investigate efforts to mislead citizens or undermine civic participation
- analyze political advertising for trends and patterns in content and effect
- collaborate with the Quartz audience to help spot efforts to mislead or divide them
augment classic investigative reporting techniques with audience engagement, machine learning, and crowdsourcing tools
- brainstorm, strategize, and plan story directions and lines of inquiry
- work directly on stories, research, visualizations, or web applications 

We will work as a team, and on sub-teams, with opportunities for individual focus in any of these areas. Together, all students will take part in contemporary tactics used by today’s leading news organizations. Student work Quartz publishes will be credited by name.

Our objective is to learn real skills around considering and conducting online investigations by conducting — and, we hope, publishing — an actual investigative report.

In this class, as we do at Quartz, we celebrate, encourage, and foster a spirit of generosity and the force of ideas.

# Weekly Meetings

## Location

We meet in Room 432 every Monday from 9:30 a.m. to 12:20 pm, including a break. That said, there are a few modifications due to holidays, so check out the dates below. We may also plan one or two classes off site.

## Structure

Generally the first half of each class will consist of a knowledge-building lesson and discussion, and often a review of the previous week's assignment.

After a break, we will work directly on our investigations — brainstorming, researching, writing, coordinating with teammates, analyzing data, coding, making charts, editing, and/or meeting with the instructor. This is *your* time to get things done and work with your teammates. Use it wisely!

## Participation

This is a team-based class, and your participation is key for all 15 classes. You'll note below that being absent really hurts your grade, and right away. That's intentional — I'm placing a premium on being present.

If you are absent for some reason, be sure to seek out and do the assignment for the week. You don't want to lose those points as well.

# Tools 

## Computers in Class

Bring them! You'll use your computer in almost every class.

Be here now. Please don't email, DM, tweet, chat or otherwise communicate with people outside the class during class. Your participation with other classmates is key. If you must take a call or a text for an urgent issue, please step out of the room.

## Slack

Let's strive for a no-email class. We'll communicate using Slack, like just about every newsroom in the United States. It will also allow us to coordinate with journalists at Quartz and elsewhere.

Our Slack is [onlineinvestigations.slack.com](https://onlineinvestigations.slack.com). 

[Use this link to sign up](https://join.slack.com/t/onlineinvestigations/signup), and then use your school email address to complete the process.

Please format your "display name" using your full name, a slash, and your role. Like: **John Keefe / Instructor** or **Lisa Simpson / Student**. This will be especially helpful when other journalists join us.

## Google Drive

We'll be using a shared Google Drive folder to keep track of important documents, the investigation plan, and who's doing what. 

# Grading

## Assignments

Each class will include an assignment, announced in class and posted on this site the same day. Assignments are due by _5 p.m. on the Friday before the next class_. Note that these Fridays may occur during holidays, so save yourself some stress and get them in _before_ the holiday begins.

## Points

There are 100 points possible.

* **Attendance:** 45 points possible, 3 points for each class attended. 
* **Assignments:** 45 points possible, 3 points for each assignment successfully completed on time. Incomplete or low-effort submissions will receive fewer or zero points. Assignments turned in after they are due receive a maximum of 1 point.
* **Participation & Progress:** 10 points possible. This will be scored based on your active participation and contribution in class and in the investigation. Note that absences will naturally cut into your participation score.

## Scale

| Points | Grade |
| ------ | ----- |
| 97-100 |  A+ |
| 93-96 | A |
| 90-92 | A- |
| 87-89 | B+ |
| 83-86 | B |
| 80-82 | B- |
| 77-79 | C+ |
| 73-76 | C |
| 70-72 | C- |
| < 70 | F |

## Plagiarism

Plagiarism is the use of another’s ideas or words, video or recordings, or ideas without properly and clearly acknowledging the source of the information.

This is a journalism class; facts and honesty are our greatest asset. Presenting the work of others as your own is wrong and won't be tolerated. Doing so may result in a significant reduction of accumulated points and possible failure of the class.

When using code or ideas from other sources -- even free, open-sourced code -- be sure to abide by any applicable licenses and include references and links back to the code and licenses. The lack of a license does not mean it's free to use. If you have questions about this, have a conversation with the instructor.

If you are inspired by others, note it. It's just right.

When working on teams, as we will in this class, you may be asked to honestly note the specific and/or relative contributions of each teammate.

Please note that other forms of academic dishonesty include:

- Unauthorized collaboration.
- Fabrication of information, quotes, or sources.
- Impeding the work of others.

# Class Plans

Below is a rundown of what I expect we'll cover in our weeks together. Be very aware, though, that this is a live journalism class: we will be working on real investigations we hope to publish, and we won't know the shape of those investigations at the outset. That means our class plans may change to help you succeed in your investigation. Significant changes in class lessons, topics, or plans will be announced in class, posted in the `#general` Slack channel, and updated here at least a week ahed of time.

**Notes** for each lesson will be posted here before each class.

**Assignments** are due at 5 p.m. on the Friday prior to the next class.

# Class 1 • Jan 27

**Kickoff:** Hello! In the first class we'll get to know each other and discuss the logistics and outlines of the semester. We'll also explore the basics of investigative reporting and the mission of the investigations team at Quartz — which you are essentially joining starting today.

**Investigations:** What are we going to investigate? That planning begins today with discussion, research, and some brainstorming.

# Class 2 • Feb 3

**Anatomy of a Facebook Investigation** You'll learn about a powerful tool we have at our disposal — The Facebook Political Ad Collector — from one of the creators of that tool, Quartz's Jeremy B. Merrill. He'll walk you through how it works and how you can use it.

Jeremy and Quartz's Hanna Kozlowska will then talk about how the ad collector led to a huge investigation into a gold- and silver-selling scheme that cheats conservative older people out of their retirement savings.

**Investigations** We'll review and discuss the stories you found and use those as a jumping-off point to explore and, we hope, zero in on avenues of exploration. We will likely define our initial teams as well.

## Assignment

- **Watch** [this online investigations video from ONA 2019](https://livestream.com/accounts/26035773/events/8806759/player?width=640&height=360&enableInfoAndActivity=true&defaultDrawer=&autoPlay=true&mute=false).

- **Post** a screenshot of something interesting you found using each tool (so three images total) into the `#general` Slack channel. Try to use examples related to your investigation.

# Class 3 • Feb 10

**Working securely:** Let's talk about security. We'll get into how you can start practicing better personal security and about how to act responsibly and ethically with the data you get from others.

**Reminder:** No class next week.

## Assignment

    - On your honor, a statement that you completed the assignment
    - Any additional (and optional) security steps you took
